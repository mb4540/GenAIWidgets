--- Message 1 (Step 1, user) ---
Content: hello

--- Message 2 (Step 2, assistant) ---
Content: Hello! I'm Web Search, your dedicated research assistant. I'm here to help you find and gather information from the internet.

To get started, I need a little more information about what you're looking for. Could you please tell me:

1.  **What topic, subject, or area of interest would you like me to research?**
2.  **Are there any specific websites, domains, or types of sources (like news articles, academic papers, or government reports) you'd like me to focus on or avoid?**
3.  **What kind of information are you seeking?** (e.g., a general overview, specific facts, recent news, expert opinions, historical data)
4.  **How would you like the information presented?** (e.g., a concise summary, bullet points, a detailed report, a comparison table)

Once I have a clear understanding of your needs, I can create a plan to find exactly what you're looking for.

--- Message 3 (Step 3, user) ---
Content: 1. competitive intelligence between AT&T, TMobile, and Verizon
2. those three carriers web sites
3. mobile phone deals
4. an executive report saved to a file include links and references

--- Message 4 (Step 4, assistant) ---
Content: Excellent, thank you for providing those details. This gives me a clear direction for the research.

Based on your request, I will conduct a competitive intelligence analysis focusing on mobile phone deals from the official websites of AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. I will then compile the findings into an executive report, complete with links and references, and save it to a file for you.

Here is the plan I will follow:
- **Step 1: Research AT&T's Mobile Phone Deals.** I will navigate to the official AT&T website and identify their current promotions and deals on mobile phones.
- **Step 2: Research T-Mobile's Mobile Phone Deals.** I will do the same for T-Mobile, visiting their official site to find their latest offers.
- **Step 3: Research Verizon's Mobile Phone Deals.** I will repeat the process for Verizon, exploring their official website for current mobile phone deals.
- **Step 4: Synthesize Findings and Draft Executive Report.** I will analyze and compare the deals from all three carriers, structuring the information into a clear and concise executive report. This report will highlight the key offers and include direct links to the source pages on each carrier's website.
- **Step 5: Save the Report to a File.** I will save the final executive report as a document.

I will now begin with Step 1. Please stand by.
